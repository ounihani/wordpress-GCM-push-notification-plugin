# wordpress-GCM-push-notification-plugin
This is a wordpress Plugin which is responsible for send push notifications to registered androi devices

#what you need to integrate the push notification service in your WordPress website :

1) you have to have a WordPress website 

2) you have to get a GCM api Key (if you don't know how chech this link : http://www.connecto.io/kb/knwbase/getting-gcm-sender-id-and-gcm-api-key/ )


3) open the index file using a text editor : replace "your key"  in the code with you actual api key obtained from the last step

4) install the plugin into your wordpress website

5) add the suitable code to your app to register and listen for the push notifications (if you don't know how just google it )



PS : the code is quite simple and well commented if you want to edit something or understand how it works just open the index.php file with a text editor and get your hands dirty
